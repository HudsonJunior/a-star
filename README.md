# A-Star Algorithm for Board Game

This project implements the **A-Star (A\*) algorithm** to solve pathfinding within a board game. It was developed as part of the **Algorithmic Modeling and Optimization** course's second evaluation at the State University of Maring√° (UEM).

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Applies A-Star to identify optimal paths within a board game environment.
- **Course**: Algorithmic Modeling and Optimization (UEM)

This project explores advanced pathfinding techniques and optimization strategies using the A-Star algorithm.
